    "An observation is a measurements of a variable. For this library, the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) list of [observed variable codes](http://codes.wmo.int/wmdr/ObservedVariable) is useful, providing elements such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Air Temperature](http://test.wmocodes.info/wmdr/ObservedVariable/_atmosAirTemperature)\n",
    "- [Humidity](http://test.wmocodes.info/wmdr/ObservedVariable/_landSurfaceHumidity)\n",
    "- [Precipitation](http://test.wmocodes.info/wmdr/ObservedVariable/_amountOfPrecipitation)\n",
    "- [Atmospheric Pressure](http://test.wmocodes.info/wmdr/ObservedVariable/_atmosphericPressure)\n",
    "- [Pressure Tendency](http://test.wmocodes.info/wmdr/ObservedVariable/_atmosPressureTendency)\n",
    "- [Present Weather](http://test.wmocodes.info/wmdr/ObservedVariable/_atmosPressureTendency)\n",
    "- [Wind (surface wind direction and speed, horizontal)](http://test.wmocodes.info/wmdr/ObservedVariable/_atmosHorizontalSurfaceWind)\n",
    "- [Gust Speed](http://test.wmocodes.info/wmdr/ObservedVariable/_atmosGustSpeed)\n",
    "- [Dew point temperature](http://test.wmocodes.info/wmdr/ObservedVariable/_atmosDewPointTemperature)\n",
    "- [Horizontal Visibility](http://test.wmocodes.info/wmdr/ObservedVariable/_horizontalVisibility)\n",
    "- [Type of Cloud](http://test.wmocodes.info/wmdr/ObservedVariable/_atmosCloudType)\n",
    "- [Height of Cloud Base](http://test.wmocodes.info/wmdr/ObservedVariable/_atmosCloudBaseHeight)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also a few elements that I'm yet to classify properly:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cloud Coverage:\n",
    "    - Can be measure in [Okta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okta)\n",
    "    - Could be classified as [Cloud Amount](http://test.wmocodes.info/wmdr/ObservedVariable/_cloudparticlesAmount)\n",
    "    \n",
    "The `observation.IObservedVariable` provides a base interface to record such observations by tracking:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The measurement itself\n",
    "- Where the measurement was taken - the lat, long, elevation\n",
    "- When the measurement was taken - using the local time\n",
    "- What took the measurement - i.e. an observing/weather station\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst a fixed weather station makes the inclusion of the \"Where\" element redundant, I have included it in the data for an observation so that the observation instance can stand more on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulties around the measurements include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Observations are scalar (a single number) but measurements have 0, 1 or 2 dimensions\n",
    "    - Weather and Type of Cloud have no dimensions and are statements (e.g. Sunny, Partly cloudy)\n",
    "    - Temperature has 1 dimension - the scale, such as Celsius (e.g. 35â„ƒ)\n",
    "    - Wind speed has 2 dimensions - the distance and time (e.g. 25 kmh)\n"
